# Task ID: 3
# Title: Phase 3: Advanced Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement advanced features and optimizations (1 week)
# Details:
Add inline editing capabilities, implement swipe gestures for mobile, optimize performance with lazy loading and caching, improve accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, and create an advanced settings panel for power users.

# Test Strategy:
Performance testing, accessibility testing (WCAG compliance), cross-browser testing, gesture testing on mobile devices

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Inline Editing for Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the ability to edit script content directly within the viewing interface without requiring users to switch to a separate edit mode.
### Details:
Create an editable content system using contentEditable or a rich text editor component. Implement auto-saving functionality that preserves changes after a brief period of inactivity. Add visual indicators to show which elements are editable on hover. Include formatting controls that appear contextually when text is selected. Ensure proper validation and error handling for edited content.

## 2. Add Swipe Gestures for Mobile Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement touch-based swipe gestures to allow mobile users to navigate between steps in the script creation process.
### Details:
Integrate a touch gesture library like Hammer.js to detect horizontal swipe actions. Add smooth transitions between steps when swiping left (next) or right (previous). Implement velocity-based animations that respond to the speed of the user's swipe. Include visual indicators during swipe to show the destination. Add haptic feedback for successful navigation events on supported devices.

## 3. Optimize Performance with Lazy Loading and Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve application performance by implementing lazy loading for content and establishing an effective caching strategy.
### Details:
Implement intersection observer API to load content only when it's about to enter the viewport. Set up a service worker to cache static assets and API responses. Add prefetching for likely next steps based on user navigation patterns. Implement image optimization with responsive loading based on device capabilities. Create a memory management system that unloads content that's no longer needed.

## 4. Improve Accessibility with ARIA and Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the application's accessibility by adding proper ARIA attributes and implementing comprehensive keyboard navigation.
### Details:
Audit existing components and add appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties. Implement focus management system that maintains a logical tab order. Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions with a visible shortcut reference. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with visible focus states. Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes and important notifications.

## 5. Create Advanced Settings Panel for Power Users [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive settings panel that allows power users to customize their experience and access advanced features.
### Details:
Design a modal or sidebar settings panel with categorized options. Implement user preference persistence using localStorage or user profiles. Add advanced options including theme customization, keyboard shortcut configuration, default view preferences, and performance settings (caching levels, prefetch behavior). Include export/import functionality for settings to share configurations between devices or users.
