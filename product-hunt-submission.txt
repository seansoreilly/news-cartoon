FIRST COMMENT
-------------
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built News Cartoon because I was tired of doom-scrolling through depressing news feeds. I wanted a way to stay informed while also finding humor in the chaos.

The app fetches real news from your area (or any topic you choose) and uses Google's Gemini AI to create editorial cartoons that capture the essence of each story with satirical wit. Think of it as having your own personal political cartoonist who never sleeps.

What makes it unique:
- Location-based news fetching for hyper-local content
- Three-step AI pipeline that creates concepts, scripts, and final artwork
- Built-in humor enhancement to ensure the cartoons are actually funny
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse while keeping it free to use

Try it with your city or a trending topic - I'd love to hear what cartoons it creates for your news!

Built with React, TypeScript, and lots of caffeine. Open to feedback and feature suggestions!
